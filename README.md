# BCIT - React Movie Database
Welcome fellow coding enthusiasts o/

This is a Mega React Project using Vite & the TMDB Movie Api, ONA FILMS. <br>
Below are screenshots of What the Website looks like. Aall attributions have been given to TMDB on the website itself. <br>


- If you'd like to take look at it yourself, 'Git Clone The Repo' as the Login & Password is in the *Login.jsx* file. <br>
- In essense, this project was created using the *React Router* rather than the regular default. 
- We used Plugins such as: Splide.js, so you may need to install a package before running the Project.

- Make sure you have pulled the latest updates of main as we will be tweaking this project with updates.
- When running, make sure you're in the Project Folder /ReactDatabase/ , then run pnpm run dev. 
- If there are any errors, make sure you have all packages installed (node_modules).


[ Happy Developing! :) ]
